2 Human limitations
    Inability to remember good secure passwords
    Inability to compare strings
        - Good XKCD (Correct Horse Battery Lightbulb) comic about this on my boss's desk. IS that really the best way to make a secure password? If so, that could be a good project, to visualize such a thing.
        - Strong/good password mean passwords that can't be socially engineered
        - Meaningless passwords mean hashs, that make a LOT more sense to a computer comparing bits than a human comparing characters
        - People are much better at comparing meaningFUL strings
        - People are good at comparing pictures
    
What is the Handbook of Applied Cryptography
Look into 
[10] Alfred J. Menezes, Paul van Oorschot, and Scott
Vanstone. Handbook of Applied Cryptography. CRC
Press, 1997.

Hash function h is 
    Compression 
        Maps x of arbitrary length to h(x) fixed amount
    Ease of computation
        h(x) is always easy to compute
    Preimage resistance
        No h(x) = h(y)
        No similar hashes for two seperate inputs
    2nd-preimage resistance
        h(x) != h(h(x))
    Collision resistance
        no h(x) == h(y)
        How is this different from preimage resistance?

For a visual hash function h1
    Maps arbitrary x to finite h1(x)
    Easy to compute

If two images h1 and h2 are perceptually indistinguishable
    h1~h2
